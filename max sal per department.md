#### Solution 1:
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT 
    e.name AS employee_name,
    d.name AS department,
    e.salary AS salary
  FROM employee e
  LEFT OUTER JOIN department d
    ON e.departmentId = d.id
),
RankedCTE AS (
  SELECT 
    employee_name, 
    department, 
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS Rankk
  FROM CTE
)
SELECT employee_name, department, salary
FROM RankedCTE
WHERE Rankk = 1;
```

#### Solution 2:
```sql
WITH MaxSalaries AS (
    SELECT 
        departmentId,
        MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
)

SELECT 
    E.name AS empname,
    D.name AS deptname,
    E.salary
FROM Employee E
JOIN MaxSalaries M
    ON E.departmentId = M.departmentId AND E.salary = M.max_salary
JOIN Department D
    ON E.departmentId = D.id;
